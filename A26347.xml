            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THat theſe Churches once flouriſhed, with much ſpiritual proſperity, under a glorious diſpenſation of the Spirit and grace of God, by the ſaving adminiſtrations of his word and worſhip, and that with full demonſtration of his ſpecial grace and favour; we ought to commemorate, unto his praiſe and glory, and our own preſent ſhame and confuſion. That now we are a people in extream danger of periſhing, in our own ſins, and under Gods Judgements, (unleſs God ſhall pleaſe in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, of Soveraign mercy to ſave us) is the moſt humbling conſideration of our preſent ſad condition. That all ordinary means (in that extraordinary way of improvement which God hath of late ſet us under) have been altogether ineffectual, unto a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſaving work of reformation; makes it (at leaſt) a fearful que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether our degeneracy and apoſtacy may not prove Judicial, and ſo perpetual: a queſtion which will not admit of a comfortable reſolution, <hi>until God ſhall pour out his Spirit from on high upon us.</hi> That Soveraign promiſe of the donation, and effuſion of the Spirit, and ſo of the diſpenſation of ſaving grace (as it hath been unto the Churches in all Ages, under their deepeſt defection,) So it is unto us the main ſtay of our faith, confidence, and comfort, and that which gives ſome preſent reviving, unto our languiſhing hope; of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion in theſe Churches. That God doth at preſent ſo far ſuſpend the accompliſhment of this promiſe, and ſo far with-hold his Spirit and grace, it is, the juſt, yet moſt dreadful puniſhment of that moſt ſinful abuſe of it; and general unprofitableneſs under the means of grace, and of that reſiſting his Spirit; and rejecting his Son by unbelief and diſobedience unto the Goſpel which is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and is ſadly ſignal of the gradual ceſſation of the work of Converſion, and of the further execution of Gods wrath, both by external and ſpiritual plagues and Judgements. How much that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:65367:3"/>work doth already fail; the decaying and dying ſtate of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of theſe Churches, doth evidence by woful inſtance and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, there being little more left, then <hi>a name to live, and thoſe things which remain ſo ready to dye;</hi> That ſo many ſinners, do ſeem to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up Judicially, unto the ſtill growing, and prevailing ſins of the times, which both in their nature and working are ſo utterly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the progreſs of the work of Converſion, doth make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidgration of our preſent caſe much the more lamentable: eſpecially-conſidering that ſuch ſinners do remain under a ſecret, ſoveraign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Gods vindictive Juſtice; whence the word in the Miniſtry is become <hi>a ſavour of death unto death in them that periſh.</hi> What remains then; but that we do moſt enixly endeavour; (in whatſoever we may, or can poſſibly) to approve our ſelves a people more hopeful; as to Converſion, Reformation, and Salvation; labouring practically, and ſavingly to underſtand, <hi>even we at leaſt in this our day the</hi> great <hi>things</hi> of our temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal <hi>peace,</hi> and welfare, leaſt they ſhould be <hi>hidden from our eyes, becauſe we know not this time of our viſitation.</hi> How is it then the moſt important concernment of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſinners, to take heed unto themſelves, that they do not (as heretofore) hinder their own Converſion by abuſing and looſing their ſpecial day and ſeaſons of grace, or by yielding up their Souls unto the power of ſin and Satan, in thoſe wayes of ſinning, wherein their hearts will be hardned againſt the power and working of the word, and Spirit of God, unto poſitive unbelief and diſobedience, unto the Goſpel, againſt light, and ſo by giving up themſelves unto deep ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in their unregeneracy, and unto ſpiritual Apoſtacy, from that common grace which they may have received and that paſt <hi>ordinary</hi> hope of recovery, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, to 8. But that ſinners do redeem <hi>this preſent time</hi> unto a conſtant attendance upon the Miniſtry of the word; and a moſt diligent improvement of all means of grace, and operations of the Spirit, crying earneſtly unto God, and waiting inſtantly upon him for the application of Chriſt, and ſalvation in a ſaving work of grace; and that under a ſenſe of their extream neceſſity thereof, crying out as they <hi>when prickt in their heart,</hi> Act 2.31. <hi>what ſhall we do?</hi> and as he, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. <hi>what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> How ſeverely alſo then are all ſuch perſons to be reproved and warned as the moſt dangerous, deſtructive Enemyes, unto both the temporal and ſpiritual welfare, and proſperity of this people, and of theſe Churches, feeking the utter
<pb facs="tcp:65367:3"/>ruine and deſtruction both of the preſent, and ſucceeding generations; who make it their buſineſs, to hinder, obſtruct, yea, utterly to deſtroy the work of Converſion, by upholding the ſins of the times, oppoſing the dutyes of the times, corrupting the Souls of others, with error, hereſy, libertiniſme, and licentiouſneſs, weakning the hearts and hands of thoſe who labour in the work of Chriſt, for the ſalvation of Souls, by all means croſſing and counter-working the whole work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: ſuch do declare themſelves to be <hi>full of all miſchief, Children of the Devil, and Enemies of all righteouſneſs, Act.</hi> 13.10. &amp; incurre that woe pronounced by our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.19 Therefore all thoſe who would approve themſelves to be true friends to the work of Chriſt in the promotion of his Kingdome, the propagation of Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, ought to labour moſt intenſly in their ſeveral places, by all means with all their might to promote converting work, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amongſt the Riſing Generations: Godly parents &amp; Maſters, heads of Families, by the conſtant exerciſe of the worſhip of God; in the life and power of it, by dayly inſtructions; admonitions, and all kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious education, by the right, and full improvement of Family go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, training up Children and Servants <hi>in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord,</hi> and this with ſincere deſire, and fervent prayer, for their Converſion. Churches by upholding a powerful diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word and all Ordinances, and a full ſupply of all proviſion in the houſe of God, eſpecially a full and compleat Miniſtry, according to Chriſts appointment, that all means may be uſed and all duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed toward the Children of the Covenant, and the riſing Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is neceſſary unto their Converſion; that they may not periſh in their unregeneracy, through the neglect of that duty, and want of help to diſcharge it fully, which is, and is yet more likely to be the ſad caſe of theſe Churches: <hi>O let us pray the Lord of the harveſt, to thruſt forth Labourers into this great harveſt.</hi> The Miniſtry <hi>by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in birth with Souls till Chriſt be formed in them,</hi> and by the full and ſaithful diſcharge of duty as <hi>Labourers together with God</hi> in that work; wherein therefore they are to labour in a way of dependance upon Chriſt for aſſiſtance and ſucceſs, and that both publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, in all wayes, and by all means, to gain and bring home Souls to him, as that which is the great end of their miniſtrations, wherein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are under great diſcouragement at preſent, from the diminution of that grace and bleſſing which might make their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb facs="tcp:65367:4"/>more effectual unto the work of converſion. The godly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Magiſtracy, by the improvement of civil Authority, in a way of full and direct ſubverciency unto the work of Chriſt, the progreſs of which is the higheſt and moſt ſaving <hi>good</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of government, unto <hi>a Religious people;</hi> who are in the moſt happy and proſperous eſtate, when <hi>the Mountains bring peace, and the little hills Righteouſneſs.</hi> Truly then it is high time for all orders, degrees &amp; ſocieties of men in <hi>New-England,</hi> by faith in prayer, to <hi>ſeek the Lord until he come and rain righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs upon us, until he open Rivers in high places, and fountains in the midſt of Valleys, and make the wilderneſs a Pool of water; and the dry Land Springs of water, until he pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground, 'till he pour out his Spirit upon our Seed, and his bleſſing upon our Offſpring,</hi> until he <hi>ſend</hi> us the great <hi>promiſe</hi> of his Spirit, in the accompliſhment of it, by pouring out of his Spirit in a general, plentiful diſpenſation of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace upon us, our Children, Familyes, Churches, this whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both the ſtanding and the riſing Generations: Which would be a bleſſed Refurrection, and as life from the dead unto us. It is much for our encouragement that in this our periſhing condition, God hath by his Spirit in the Miniſtry of many of his Servants, propoſed this great promiſe; expreſſing his own gratious diſpoſition to open and apply it, in the ſaving grace and bleſſing of it, and withal preſſed us, from the conſideration of inevitable deſtruction, without a full and perfect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the application of it, and furniſhed us with all Arguments of faith, to labour and prevail with him in prayer for the obtainment of it: which alſo is the more ſolemnly obſervable, in that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially ordered the labours of divers of his Servants, in this <hi>ſame great</hi> and moſt neceſſary ſubject to be publiſhed at this time, as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony unto this Generation, what their main work and duty is; whereby <hi>he hath ſhewed us what is good, and what it is that the Lord doth require at our hands.</hi> God grant that it may not be rejected, and ſo be left upon Record, as a Teſtimony againſt this Generation to condemn it, the more deeply, under the aggravated guilt of total &amp; final Apoſtacy</p>
            <p>The Reverend and worthy Author of theſe Sermons, having been through the abundant grace of God ſanctified, and ſeperated from his youth, unto the Miniſtry, he hath had a more early call into that work, wherein he hath been more happy then moſt of his fellow Servants; and being himſelf coaetaneous with, and amongſt the choiceſt of the
<pb facs="tcp:65367:4"/>firſt ripe fruits of this young Generation; his Soul hath laboured, and doth labour, with the more fervency, of holy and ſincere love to, and zeal for, the ſalvation of their Souls: modeſty and humility being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him as gifts, both of nature and grace, it would be too much an injury to him, to give his work deſerved commendation: It ſhall therefore ſuffice to ſay, that the powerful and (we hope) ſaving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which it had in the miniſtration of it, upon the hearts of the hearers, is a Teſtimony of divine approbation and commendation: the ſuitableneſs and ſeaſonableneſs of the Subject unto <hi>this</hi> time, and the neceſſity of <hi>this</hi> people, the copiouſneſs, and (yet withal) conciſeneſs of the method (it being expreſſive of ſo much of the general meſſage which God is ſending unto his people, and of that which the Spirit is now ſpeaking unto theſe Churches in ſo few Sermons) doth render it the more fit, and uſeful for the publick. The motion of the Spirit of God upon the hearts of thoſe pious and judicious hearers, who have (we believe) been thereby moved with a godly zeal for the ſaving good of the Generation to deſire, requeſt, and undertake for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it; doth promiſe it Patronage from Heaven. The ſpecial promiſed preſence of our Lord Jeſus with this his Servant, for his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in the Miniſtry of his word, as alſo in the whole courſe of his miniſtration, is a ſingular token, and pledge of his ſpecial grace and favour, unto that pretious Church in, and unto which he is called to miniſter. The Lord make them more and more thankful, profitable, and fruitful, and proſper his work with them, granting unto them more clear and full diſcoveries of his mind and will concerning their duty in order thereunto, <hi>that they may ſtand more perfect and compleat in all the will of God;</hi> and be more fully repleniſhed with his ſpiritual and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence; <hi>inriched</hi> with all the gifts and graces of his Spirit, &amp; ſetled (together with all our Churches) under the ſaving diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant of grace, ſtrengthned unto ſtedfaſt perſeverance, in the faith, obedience, and order of the Goſpel, unto the end.</p>

            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter there is a Propheſy of the righteous and proſperous reign of a <hi>King,</hi> whoſe Subjects ſhall live in a comfortable and happy condition under his government, things and perſons ſhall be called by their right names, a wicked man ſhall be called a wicked man, a good man owned for a good man, and every one treated rightly, and all things managed righteouſly, every perſon and thing handled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their true merits, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, <hi>to</hi> 9. And this <hi>King</hi> is by ſome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Engl. Annot. But by others <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under whoſe reign eſpecially all theſe things are accompliſhed. <hi>Jun. in loc.</hi> Chriſt does indeed alwayes rule, but there is at ſome times a more eminent and powerful adminiſtration of his Kingdome, wherein there is a more viſible and plenary fulfilling of the things here ſpoken of, and to ſome ſuch time may this Propheſy have reſpect.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of the Chapter the Prophet diſcourſeth of thoſe troubles that were to come upon the Land of his People, before their eſtabliſhment in and under the proſperity formerly deſcribed.</p>
            <p>And 1. He begins with a ſolemn warning and Exhortation to all ſecure careleſs ones to be awakened by their miſery coming, and to break off their evil courſes, and to betake themſelves to humiliation,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65367:6"/>lamentation, and ſo to Reformation, if thereby they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or at leaſt moderate the Judgement impending over them. Ver. 9, to 13. <hi>Riſe up ye Women that are at eaſe, hear my voice ye eareleſs daughters, give ear unto my Speech: Many dayes and years ſhall ye be troubled, ye careleſs Women,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tremble ye Women that are at eaſe,</hi> &amp;c. Would careleſs ſecure Men and Women be awakened by warnings given, much of their ſorrow might be diverted. Had we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fooliſh People in New-England been wiſe in ſeaſon, and taken thoſe ſolemn warnings have been given us, much of that ſorrow and miſery which we have felt, and do feel in War, ſickneſs, and other ſhakings might have been eſcaped. 2. He declares (ſeeing they had not by Repentance diverted Gods Anger, but were ſecure) their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement under a diſpenſation of Judgement, and the continuance and proceſs of their miſeryes to a determined period, at which there ſhould be a great turn and change of Gods diſpenſations towards them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>to</hi> 19. <hi>read.</hi> 3. In the two laſt Verſes, whether read by themſelves, or joyned with the foregoing, he deſcribes the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs and ſecurity both of their perſons, and enjoyments, upon and for whom this change is wrought, however it ſare with others: when ſorrows come down upon others they ſhall be ſecured. The expreſſions here uſed being probably metaphorical. <hi>Vide Sanctium in Pol. Synop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Text we have 1. A declaration of the ſettlement of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under a diſpenſation of Judgement, and the proceſs of Judgements and miſeries upon them. How troubles &amp; ſorrows ſhould come, grow upon &amp; overſpread them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.14. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Land of my People ſhall come up Thorns &amp; Briars</hi>] <hi>Thorns &amp; Bryars</hi> may be here taken <hi>literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp; ſo the expreſſion denotes the great devaſtation &amp; depopulation ſhould be made in the Land. They may alſo be taken <hi>metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> as Ezek. 28 24. <hi>There ſhall be no more a pricking Brier to the houſe of Iſrael, nor any grieving Thorn of all that are round about them.</hi> So that by <hi>Thorns and Briars coming up upon the Land,</hi> we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand pricking, grieving, pinching, and diſquieting troubles falling upon the Inhabitants of the Land. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon all the houſes of joy</hi>] They are called <hi>houſes of joy,</hi> becauſe they were at preſent full of mirth and merriment in them, as miſdoubting no trouble near, <hi>Eng. Annot. in loc.</hi> And upon all theſe ſhould ſorrow come: Their troubles ſhould ſpread among, and over them univerſally, and take away their mirth and turn it into mourning. <hi>In the Joyous City</hi>] <hi>City,</hi> in a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65367:6"/>Senſe, for <hi>Cityes,</hi> the ſeveral Cityes throughout the whole Land of Judah. <hi>Annot.</hi> And theſe were <hi>joyous or revelling Cityes,</hi> given to caſe, delight and pleaſure, abounding with much Luxury, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane joy and revelling ſhould be followed with diſtreſs. <hi>Becauſe the Palaces ſhall be forſaken, the multitude of the City ſhall be left,</hi>] There ſhould be great deſolations made in the places of their dwellings both for conveniency and delight: And great diminution of their numbers, mortality and miſery lighting upon them. <hi>The Forts and Towers ſhall be for Dens.</hi>] Their places of ſtrength, munition, defence and ſafeguard being deſerted and lying waſte, ſhould become Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Dens for wild Beaſts to lye down in. <hi>For ever,</hi>] or, for a long time, As the word <hi>(Gnolam)</hi> is often uſed. <hi>Deſignat conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuationem vel durationem non perpetuam ſemper, ſed longam &amp; non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptam per aliquod tempus, &amp; continuatam ad inſignem aliquam peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odum. Spanhem. A Joy of wild Aſſes</hi>] Theſe and other wild Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould range, run at large, play and diſport themſelves there, where ſometimes dwellings and Caſtles were. <hi>A Paſture of Flocks</hi>] Cattle ſhould graze in thoſe places that were ſometimes inhabited, they being left deſolate. Theſe and the like miſeryes ſhould be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and grow upon them, being ſet under Judgement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Period of theſe miſeryes. Till which they ſhould be continued, and proceed; <hi>viz.</hi> until the Spirit ſhould be poured out upon the People, and the gracious Effects of it obtained in them v. 15. <hi>until the Spirit be poured upon us</hi>] By <hi>Spirit</hi> here which is ſaid to be poured out upon them, we may underſtand not ſo much the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt (Not here to ſpeak of the perſonal in dwelling of the Spirit in all the Saints, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14.) As the ſaving gifts and graces of the Spirit, by the donation of which, perſons are enlightned, &amp; regenerated, ſinners converted, &amp; Saints more &amp; more ſanctified. And by <hi>pouring out of the Spirit,</hi> we may underſtand a plentiful effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or giving forth of the gifts and graces of the Spirit to the ſound Converſion and through Sanctification of a People. The diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit in all the gracious and ſaving operations thereof is expreſt by giving the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39, <hi>This ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive: for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given.</hi> And by pouring out the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.45. <hi>On the Gentiles alſo was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> By the Spirit being poured out upon them therefore is intended, a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65367:7"/>and abundant meaſure of the communication of the gifts and graces of the Spirit unto them, and this was the determined period of their miſeryes. See more of this in M. <hi>I, Mather</hi> his Sermon on <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.3. Qu. 1, 2. where theſe things are directly and fully ſpoken too. <hi>From on High</hi>] from God above, Father and Son. <hi>And the Wilderneſs be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</hi>] I ſhall not trouble you with reciting the various Expoſitions given of this as in the parallel place, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.17. but only lay down and improve that, which comparing them with the Text, and one with another, I take to be moſt probable. What is therefore expreſt in the latter part of this Verſe, we may take to intimate the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effects or fruits of the pouring out of the Spirit wrought upon, or in thoſe upon whom it is poured. And they are two, 1. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the unregenerate. <hi>And the Wilderneſs be a fruitful Field,</hi> i. e. Thoſe that have been as a Wilderneſs, barren and unfruitful, bringing forth no fruit to God, but wild fruits of ſin, they ſhall be changed, tilled, converted and made fruitful, to bring forth fruits of holineſs unto God. 2. The admirable fruitfulneſs and encreaſe of grace in the godly; <hi>And the fruitful Field be counted for a Forreſt,</hi> i.e. They that have a Principle of fruitfulneſs in them, and did bring forth fruit before, yet now upon the pouring out of the Spirit upon them ſhall receive ſuch abundance of grace, and be ſo eminent in the acting of it, that what they did before ſhall be accounted as the fruit of a barren Forreſt, in compariſon of what they do now. Such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhall there be in their fruitfulneſs before and after the pouring out of the Spirit on them. Or the meaning may be <hi>The fruitful field ſhall be counted for a Forreſt, i.e.</hi> Thoſe that were before fruitful fields ſhall upon the pouring out of the Spirit fructifie ſo incredibly, that they ſhall ſeem rather to be a Wood, a Forreſt, a Thicket, then fields of Tillage, (by an appropriation of ſuch expreſſions as are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed concerning the incredible fertility of ſome Fields in grain and fruits, unto the exceeding great fruitfulneſs of perſons in grace and ſpiritual, and holy actions) And ſo the Senſe is the ſame as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Vide Angl. Annot in Iſai.</hi> 25.17. and <hi>Calvin in Pol. Synopſ. Crit. Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The great turn and change following upon the pouring out of the Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18. <hi>Then ſhall, &amp;c.</hi> The immediate Effects &amp; fruits of the pouring out of the Spirit were expreſt in the former Verſe:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65367:7"/>The mediate or more remote effect and conſequent of it, is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt to be, the reſtoration and multiplication of ſure mercies and bleſſings upon them in the Particulars mentioned in theſe verſes. And they reſpect either.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their Sanctification, as a holy and heavenly Converſation. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Then Judgement ſhall dwell in the wilderneſs,</hi> i.e. in illis qui olim Deſertum erant. <hi>Forerius in Pol. Synop. Crit. in Loc.</hi> Thoſe that were as a wilderneſs before, untilled, unt aught, unregenerate, &amp; unſubdued to the will of God, being now converted, ſhall give heed to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, equity, righteouſneſs, honeſty and piety; abandoning all ways of profaneneſs, debauchery, diſhoneſty, injuſtice, intemperance and impiety which before once they lived in. <hi>And righteouſneſs remain in the fruitfull field</hi>] Ergaſia five exornatio effectorum Spiritus Dei in Sanctis: erunt, inquit, fructus ſpiritus in arvo, i.e. Eccleſiâ Dei, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia, &amp;c. <hi>Jun. in Loc.</hi> Chriſtians, Profeſſors who have given up their names to Chriſt ſhall be ſtudiouſly carefull to hold faſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſincerity and uprightneſs in all their carriages and actions towards God and man, being plain-hearted, right-down, fair and ſquare in all their dealings: behaving themſelves in all things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, juſtly and unblameably, being harmleſs, and without rebuke, putting away all ſemblance of diſhoneſty, unjuſt dealing, unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, untruth, encroaching, covetouſneſs, double-dealing, unſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhifting, winding, turning and whatſoever elſe is unworthy the vocation wherewith they are called. And theſe ſure are bleſſed and happy times, when there are ſuch fruits of ſanctification ſo generally and univerſally appearing. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Glorification, which concern the felicity and bleſſedneſs of their lives. And they are either,</p>

Nor is it abſurd or immethodical to rank this outward peace of the Saints under glorification; for it is to them a real freedome from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery &amp; evill of puniſhment, wherein they experience the good-will &amp; kindneſs of God, and therefore is a part or degree of Glorification begun.

            <p>For the timing this Propheſy in the Text, concerning the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Spirit, and the effects and Conſequents of it, it is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fixed by Expoſitors, as, to the reſtitution of the Jewiſh ſtate after Sennacheribs defeat to the Jews return from the Babylonian Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: to the times of the Meſſiah in general; and to ſome particular time or times under the Goſpel, and that either already paſt, or yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. That this Propheſy in the Text doth reſpect ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time mainly and principally, is without doubt: But what that time is,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scriptura prophetica ſapius impletur. See Mr.</hi> Increaſe Mather <hi>his Sermon on</hi> Iſai. 44.8. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> I ſhall not make it my work to enquire or determine. It may ſuffice to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that there is a general truth in the words; and that this Scripture may be and is in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and meaſure fulfilled at other times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that to which it hath a more particular and principal reſpect; and that there is ſuch a dependance of our freedome from evills, and obtaining of mercyes upon the Spirits being poured out upon us as is expreſt in the Text. It is written for our learning, and ſo we may improve it; and to this I ſhall apply my ſelf.</p>
            <p>In treating of theſe words, I ſhall not endeavour to draw out all the ſingle obſervations from them that might be, but only to take up the general ſcope of them in this one Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>When God hath once ſet a People under a diſpenſation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their miſeryes will be like to proceed, till there be the pouring out of the Spirit from on high upon them to their ſound Converſion, and then there will be a reſtoration and multiplication of ſure mercyes and bleſſings upon them.</hi> This is the ſumme of the words, and as brief as I can
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65367:8"/>well give it. This Doctrine may be further opened in theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitions;</p>
            <p>Prop. I. <hi>God doth ſometimes ſet a People under a diſpenſation of Judgement.</hi> As this People here. The Lord in the way of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence expoſes them to Judgement, ſets them in the way of miſery, ſorrow and calamity lighting upon them, follows them with evil: The general courſe of his diſpenſations toward them is afflictive: He does as it were ſet them as a mark to ſhoot the Arrows of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and diſpleaſure at, Lam. 3.12. <hi>He hath bent his bow and ſet me as a mark for the Arrow.</hi> He marks them our for Judgement, they are a people of his anger, a generation of his wrath, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.29. he ſets himſelf againſt them, he ſets his face againſt them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.17. <hi>And I will ſet my face againſt you.</hi> He is ſore diſpleaſed with them, and ſets himſelf as it were with an angry countenance to puniſh their ſin: He engages his Power and wrath againſt them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.25. <hi>And I will ſet my Jealouſie againſt thee, and they ſhall deal furiouſly with thee.</hi> He watches over them for evil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.11, 27. <hi>Behold I will ſet my face againſt you for evil; Behold I will watch over them for evil.</hi> The Lord does as it were ſet himſelf to watch his opportunity to bring evil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, is againſt them on every ſide, and ſets himſelf to afflict them.</p>
            <p>Thus God ſometimes ſets a People under a diſpenſation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that; <hi>becauſe they have ſet themſelves in a way that is not good.</hi> They ſet themſelves out of the way of holineſs, and in the way of ſin, and hence God ſets himſelf in a way of Judgement, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.23, 24. <hi>If ye will not be reformed by theſe things, but will walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to me: then will I alſo walk contrary unto you, and will puniſh you.</hi> Gods ſetting himſelf againſt a People is, becauſe they have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt God.</p>
            <p>And 1. <hi>They have ſet themſelves againſt his Command.</hi> They have rebelled againſt him, and broken his Laws, and caſt his words behind their backs. Hence God in ſetting himſelf againſt a People ſets their ſins in the light of his Countenance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.7, 8. <hi>We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by thine anger: and by thy wrath are we troubled. Thou haſt ſet our iniquityes before thee: our ſecret ſins in the light of thy Countenance.</hi> It is becauſe of them, their ſins, that God carryes it in a way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure towards any, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.7, 8. Thus the Lord gives an account of his doing thus and thus with his People, becauſe they had ſinned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65367:9"/>ſo and ſo againſt him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.2. compared with 12.13. In the <hi>ſecond.

            <p>Prop. II. <hi>The miſery of a People once ſo ſet under a diſpenſation of Judgement will be like to proceed and be growing.</hi> Their affliction will riſe higher and higher. Their ſorrows abound more and more. Their ſorrows and miſeryes will be like to encreaſe and grow.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Intenſivè,</hi> Intenſively. Their miſeryes and ſorrows will be like to grow more intenſe and ſharp, pinching and diſtreſſing, to have more and more of divine anger in them, and ſo be more hard to be borne, and fill thoſe under them with anguiſh and vexation, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.21. <hi>And they ſhall paſs through it hardly beſtead and hungry: and it ſhall come to paſs, that when they ſhall be hungry, they ſhall fret themſelves.</hi> Their neceſſities and diſtreſſes ſhall be ſuch as ſhall make them grow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly impatient and exceedingly diſquieted, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>behold trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and darkneſs, dimneſs of anguiſh: and they ſhall be driven to darkneſs.</hi> Many words of the ſame notion are heaped up to expreſs the great extremity of their diſtreſſes. <hi>Eng.

When God is ſit in a way of Judgement againſt a people, he will make the end and iſſue of that diſpenſation <hi>a bitter day,</hi> Am. 8.10. <hi>And I will make it as the mourning of an only Son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the ſorrow and miſery of a people ſet under Judgement will be like to grow more general and more and more bitter and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe God is ſet againſt them as an Enemy;</hi> Ezek. 15.7. <hi>And I will ſet my face againſt them, they ſhall go out from one fire, and another fire ſhall devour them: and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I ſet my face againſt them.</hi> It is impoſſible but that they ſhould ſink more and more, whom God in his anger hath ſet himſelf againſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14.

            <p>Prop. III. <hi>The miſeries of ſuch a people will be like to proceed till there be a pouring out of the Spirit from on high upon them to their ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, &amp;c. Text. ver.</hi> 15. If God hath once ſo far taken a people in hand as to ſet them under a diſpenſation of Judgement, there is no grounded hope of their deliverance and releaſe in mercy, till God do in a gracious manner pour out his Spirit upon them, or wonderfully work a ſaving change in them, and among them by the effectual operation of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit: Till abundance of grace be given forth for the procuring and effecting of their found converſion.</p>
            <p>The Spirit is given or poured out for that end that there may be <hi>Converſion.</hi> And that either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Converſion of ſinners,</hi> which is expreſt in the Text by, <hi>the Wilderneſs becoming a fruitful field,</hi> Pſal. 51.13. <hi>Sinners ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto thee.</hi> The Lord ſends down his Spirit for this end to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, awaken, convert, regenerate and ſanctifie ſinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 11. to open their eyes, to turn them from darkneſs to light and from the power of Satan unto God: This is the work of the Miniſtry, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. which works effectually only through the power, preſence and aſſiſtance of the Spirit accompanying of the ſame. It is the work of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65367:11"/>the Spirit efficiently to deliver ſinners out of the power of darkneſs, and tranſlate them into the Kingdome of the dear Son of God: to make them of unholy, profane, proud and vain; ſerious, humble, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pious and conformed to the image and will of God: to love thoſe things [of God] which they have not loved nor regarded; and to hate and abandon thoſe things [of ſin, world and vanity] which they have loved and ſet their hearts upon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Converſion of Saints and Chriſtians.</hi> Which is expreſt in the Text according to the interpretation given, by; <hi>the fruitful field being counted for a forreſt.</hi> Peter was converted before Satan fifted him and made him deny his Maſter, for ſaith Chriſt; <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not:</hi> But he muſt be converted again and therefore Chriſt ſayes to him; <hi>When thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brethren,</hi> Luk. 22.32. though the relative charge of ſtate in believers is but once wrought, it is wrought at once and continues for ever, and the real change in their perſons by ſanctification is perfect in its parts, yet this latter admits of degrees: It is ſo wrought in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as that it needs conſtant carrying on in this life: and it may ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay as to need to be done over again, and ſo the Chriſtian to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the work of Converſion again, a ſecond time. Hence David prayes when he had as it were loſt the work or effect of former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, that God would <hi>create in him a clean heart, and renew a right Spirit within him,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. <q>Apprehending himſelf deprived in a manner of that holy diſpoſition and power of godlineſs, which God had formerly wrought in bm, asi before he begged for pardon, ſo here for the ſanctification of Gods Spirit. The word <hi>Renew</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hath reference to his former piety which he found greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in him, wherewith he deſires to be eſtabliſhed again. <bibl>
                     <hi>Jackson in loc.</hi>
                  </bibl>
               </q> Now this is the work of the Spirit to renew the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and carry on the work of grace in believers. He is given for this end, for the furthering the work of grace and holineſs in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in renewed and more ſtrong acts of repentance, ſaith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: to make them more free from ſin end pollution, more and more conformable to the will of God in all things, more abundantly fruitful in every good work: to enlarge them in duty: and to make their faces and converſations to ſhine, that they ſhall in good carneſt be engaged for God, his ſervice and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65367:12"/>
Hence when the Spirit is poured out upon a people, All, or the generality of them, or at leaſt very many among them will be either enquiring for, or walking in the way to Zion with their faces thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4, 5. <hi>In thoſe dayes, and in that time, ſaith the Lord, the children of Iſrael ſhall come, they and the children of Judah together, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and weeping; they ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God. They ſhall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward.</hi> Which laſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may intimate their ſincere intention and fixed reſolution to go on in the way they enquired after. <q>
                  <hi>To ſet ones face,</hi> is <hi>to fix the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and actions without declining to any other way.</hi> 
                  <bibl>Wilſon Chriſt. Diction.</bibl>
               </q> Such a people will be <hi>bound</hi> for God, having received the Spirit of God every one will <hi>go bound in the Spirit</hi> to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his duty and the glorifying and honouring of God. They ſhall be ſignally carryed out in ſeeking Gods face and doing of his will. There would appear a right and full bent of Spirit for God in perſons, doing all ſincerely in the name and in an evangellical manner exactly according to the will of the Lord Jeſus, heartily giving thanks to God and the Father by him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3, 17. The Spirit of God and of holineſs will breath and be manifeſt in them: There will be a godly ſorrow and mourning for ſin in All, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.16. <hi>But they that eſcape of them ſhall eſcape and ſhall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</hi> A hearty grief that they have diſpleaſed, diſhonoured and provoked God by their ſin: And a ſincere and earneſt care and endeavour to repair the honour and glory of Gods Name by future holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Theſe are the immediate effects and fruits of the pouring out of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And till the Spirit be thus poured out and theſe gracious effects of it in ſome good meaſure obtained to the Converſion and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a people under Judgement their miſery and ſorrow will be like to procead and continue. And that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the profaneneſs, unbelief and impenitency of ſinners, and the unholineſs and unfruitfulneſs of Chriſtians are the cauſes of theſe ſorrows and miſeryes. And as till the cauſes be removed there is no probability that the effect ſhould ceaſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.12. <hi>neither will I be with you any more, except ye deſtroy the accurſed from among you.</hi> So in order to the removal of theſe from a people, the pouring out of the Spirit from on high upon them to their ſound converſion and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65367:12"/>ſanctification is the grand expedient. And therefore till this be they will remain a generation of Gods wrath: His anger will not be like to be turned away from them till this work be wrought in and for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe till the Spirit be in ſome meaſure poured out upon them they will not be fit for mercy. They will not duely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor improve it, but profane and abuſe it. Till by the gracious work of Gods Spirit in them they be brought to a complyance with his will, they will not be in a poſture to receive mercy: They will not carry it aright under mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.8.13, 21. <hi>Nevertheleſs he ſaved them for his Names ſake, But, they ſoon forgat his works, they waited not for his Counſel. They forgat God their Saviour, which had done great things.</hi> And therefore there is little probability that God will beſtow Salvation upon ſuch a people.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Till then they will be provoking God, Though the Lord be ſtriking them they will certainly be adding new provocations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Thou haſt ſtricken them but they have not grieved: thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction, they have made their faces harder then a rock, they have refuſed to return,</hi> Iſai. 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his Covetouſneſs was I wroth and ſmote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> After this manner will they certainly do, till <hi>Soveraign grace</hi> heal them; till ſuch time as there be a gracious effuſion of the Spirit from on high upon them to change, convert and ſanctifie them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore notwithſtanding all the evil God hath done unto them, it will be probable that his Anger will not be turned away, but his hand ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtill againſt them.</p>
            <p>Prop. IV. <hi>When the Spirit from on high is poured out upon a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their ſound Converſion there will be a reſtoration and multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſure mercyes and bleſſings upon them.</hi> Though ſuch a people were under affliction and expreſſions of divine diſpleaſure before. The Seal of Gods providence would then turn towards them and there would be a remarkable, glorious and happy change among them, <hi>Text, ver.</hi> 16, 17, 18. Then there ſhould be a new face and aſpect of divine providence upon them, and the clouds of divine diſpleaſure would blow over. What before was taken away or withheld from them ſhould be then reſtored or given, and what mercy they want, beſtowed upon them. They ſhould have mercyes and bleſſings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65367:13"/>that are worthy the name of bleſſings, ſtore of ſure mercyes and bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There would be great holineſs.</hi> Holineſs would abound: There would be <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi> as it were engraven in bells and pots, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20.21. Holineſs would be conſpicuous both in perſons and actions.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We ſhould then ſee ſinners ſtudying and following after Holineſs.</hi> Chriſtians might then ſee thoſe ignorant profane, wicked creatures, whom they now with grief behold or hear of, that they mind nothing but their vanity, their pride, exceſs, intemperance, diſorder, who now will not be perſwaded to pray, to read, or hear the word of God with diligence, reverence and obedience, who will be profane, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, intemperate, negligent, irreligious, who will do any thing but what they ſhould, and every thing that they ſhould not: But then we might ſee them ſerious, humble, attentive to what is good, acting in the fear of God, diligent and ſtudious to know the will of God, careful to pleaſe God, fearful of diſpleaſing him, circumſpect in their actions, Chriſtian in their behaviour, adorning the doctrine of the Goſpel, denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and living ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteouſly &amp; godly in the world, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 32.4. <hi>The heart alſo of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledge.</hi>

The righteous and holy God ſeems to be now weary of repenting concerning us, as he hath oftentimes done, and not to act towards us as formerly: When his hand hath been upon us heretofore he hath repented and not ſtirred up all his wrath, As, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38. <hi>But he being full of compaſſion forgave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not, yea, many a time turned he his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and did not ſtir up all his wrath.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106, 44, 45. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry.

But publick petitions put up for publick deliverance, help and mercy, ſeem to be thrown by, not to be received or granted. And this is an Argument of a diſpenſation of Judgement.

But when he ſets his ſace againſt them then he denyes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their prayers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12. <hi>When they faſt I will not hear their cry.</hi> He forbids his faithful Servants to pray for them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry, or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.</hi> And if the eminenteſt of his Servants do pray for them, he will not hear them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet my mind could not be towards this people.</hi> The Lord does as it were abſcond, withdraw and conceal himſelf from ſuch a people that he may not be found by them: ſeems to cover up himſelf that their cry and prayer may not come at him to trouble him in that which he intends not to do, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8, 44. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.1, 2. <hi>Let them kill Sacrifices: yet I will diſtreſs Ariei, and there ſhall be heavineſs and ſorrow.</hi> And after this manner is the diſpenſation of God to us at this day. And therefore oh that we could ſee that we are in a bad caſe that we were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65367:17"/>indeed ſenſible of the miſery and danger of our condition being thus ſet under Judgement! It is our great miſery that nothing will a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us.

Shall God break us to pieces, make us to go backward, to ſtumble and fall, and be broken, and ſnared and taken, and ſtop his ear to our cryes, and ſhall not we be affected with our miſery? Oh that we could hold up our hard hearts to be broken by the powerful hand of a gracious God Lord ſmite theſe Rocks! Make us ſenſible! Make us relent! Make us mourn under thine anger!</p>

Hence ſee <hi>a reaſon of the continuance and growing of our ſorrows.</hi> We are ſet under a diſpenſation of Judgment, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not yet poured out from on high upon us. And therefore no wonder if our troubles grow more extenſive, numerous and general; and more intenſe, ſharp and piercing. God hath in juſt anger ſet himſelf againſt us, and we are not yet turned and ſet for him by the effectual pouring out of the Spirit upon, and working of it in us. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How little kindly and ſincere mourning for ſin is there among us?</hi> That is one ſpecial effect of the pouring out of the Spirit on a people that have been rebellious; <hi>They ſhall look upon him, whom they have pierced and mourn, Zech.</hi> 12.10. They ſhall mourn for their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and for their neglects of Chriſt. But how little of this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do we hear of amongſt us in theſe dayes? Men and Women are heart whole, though there be much guilt upon them, and it may be their corruptions are yet whole and entire in them: They can do this and that evil and neglect this and that duty, and yet not mourn. There are many poor creatures can rejoyce in their ſins: But, Alas; how few are in bitterneſs for them? where are the perſons that ſow in tears, that go forth and weep bearing precious feed, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.5, 6. Many are apt to make their moan for want of <hi>health,</hi> want of <hi>peace,</hi> want of <hi>money, &amp;c.</hi> But how few are there that lament and mourn truly for want of <hi>a broken heart,</hi> for want of <hi>pardon of ſin,</hi> the <hi>favour</hi> of God and his grace? Were there more of this, there would be hope. As is the Proverb; <hi>Corn ſowen in a flood comes up like a wood:</hi> Were there this ſowing in floods of tears of true repentance, we might then hope for an abundance of the fruits and graces of the Spirit and the bleſſings accomyanying them to follow. But, alas! how low are our hopes from this ground?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How little activity and delight in the ſervice and worſhip of God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65367:17"/>and reaching after Communion with God therein is there among us?</hi> how dull, cold and unſpiritual are moſt in the work and ſervice of God? Now the Spirit is a <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> and if that were poured out on us we ſhould be lively, active, and vigorous in the ſervice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, Joh. 6.63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth.</hi> We ſhould ſerve God with utmoſt intention and affection, we ſhould be never better then when in his preſence reaching after communion with him. As David, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. and 42.1, 2. But alas how little is our beart drawn out to, and ſtrength put forth in the houſe, worſhip and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God! we drive too heavily, we either want wheels, or oyl to our wheels.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>How little of a praying frame, of a ſpirit of grace and ſupplication is among us?</hi> Where the Spirit of Chriſt is, there are theſe Abba's, thoſe groanings that cannot be uttered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father,</hi> Rom. 8.26. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> Where there is any good meaſure of the Spirit there is liberty of acceſs to God, there will be freedome of pouring out the the heart before God and ſtrong wreſtling with God, holy importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and taking the Kingdome of heaven by violence. But alas how little is there of theſe things? Our prayers are too cold, dead, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, lifeleſs, inſipid and wordy only. How little of a melting frame in our prayers and humble brokenneſs therein, and how little vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment breathings of Soul after, and ſtrong actings of faith upon the Lord Jeſus therein? How little of patient and painful wreſtlings with the Lord in them? How little of earneſt looking after prayers, and believing expectation, and waiting for a gracious anſwer of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>How little ſtudying and practiſing of Holineſs is among us?</hi> Little of a Goſpel-becoming converſation.

5. <hi>How little breathings of love to God, his wayes, Ordinances and Saints are among us?</hi> Were the holy Ghoſt in the gifts and graces of it given to us in plentiful manner, the love of God would be ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in our hearts, it would be much there, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt which is given to us.</hi> We ſhould entirely love God and dearly love his word, Saints and wayes: The bent and ſtream of our affections would be turned this way. But alas! How low does our affection run to God, to his houſe, to his word, to his Ordinances, and one to another. How eager are we in our purſuits of other things? but after theſe not ſo earneſt.</p>
            <p>It is too too evident that of theſe things mentioned there is too little among us, but of their contraryes too much: There is too much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in, and impenitency for ſinning; too much neglect of, formality and deadneſs in prayer; too much of wearineſs in and under, and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs to the worſhip &amp; ſervice of God; too much heedleſsneſs, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs, unholineſs &amp; profaneneſs in converſation; too much loathing, ſlighting, undervaluing &amp; diſregarding of God his word, Ordinances &amp; Saints: Which plainly ſhow our want of the pouring out of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And hence is our trouble continued and growing.</p>

Learn <hi>to obſerve the motions and breathings of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that we may diſcern the ſigns of the times.</hi> We are from this Text informed that the pouring out, or with-holding of the Spirit, hath a great influence to alter or diſpoſe the frame or manner or ſtate of times and diſpenſations: And therefore this diſpenſation of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Spirit is a ſpecial <hi>ſigne</hi> of the times, a ſigne for us to know the times by, or to underſtand what the work of God is, or is like to be in the times we live in. It is the duty of Chriſtians to labour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſigns of the times, for want of which our Saviour blames and ſharply reproves thoſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.3. <hi>O ye hypocrites, ye can diſcern the face of the sky, but can ye not diſcern the ſignes of the times?</hi> Luk. 12.56. <hi>But how is it that ye do not diſcern this time?</hi> That was the time of the Meſſiah and his coming; of which there were ſpecial ſigns by which they might have apprehended and underſtood it, had they been wiſe and diligent to have marked the ſame. <q>The ſignes of any times they are thoſe viſible appearances of Gods providence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God leads us to diſcern that which is more inward as to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, intentions and expectations.</q> By theſe ſignes we may be led to obſerve or underſtand what God intends with, or to a people in ſuch or ſuch a time, which way the providence of God is at preſent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65367:18"/>or like to work toward ſuch a people, what God is doing with or among them. Now the Spirit of God in the pouring out or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of it, being a ſpecial eminent and remarkable ſigne of the times, by a wiſe and prudent obſervation of the motions and workings of that, we may be ſignally led to this diſcerning of the times. And therefore let all Chriſts diſciples take due notice and obſervation of this matter. And conſider particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What movings of the Spirit there are in the Souls of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in theſe times.</hi> What ſolemn awakenings and ſound convictions wrought by the Spirit in the hearts of finners: what wooings and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurings to draw their Souls unto God: What noiſe there is, ruſhing and ſhaking cauſed by the wind of the Spirit among the <hi>dry bones.</hi> Do we ſee them coming together bone to his bone, and ſtanding up on their feet from the dead? Is the Spirit of God ſtriving, mightily ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, powerfully and irreſiſtibly working upon the hearts of ſecure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Does it force them to cry out of their ſin and miſery, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and woful condition? Does it terrifie them from perſiſting in, or medling with iniquity? Does it humble and make them look about them with greateſt care and ſollicitude how they may do to eſcape the wrath of God and to obtain Salvation? Are theſe workings of the Spirit upon the hearts of ſmners in theſe times? Speak you who ſtill remain unregenerate! Is the Spirit of God ſtill dealing with you by awakening, warning and not letting you alone to go on in ſin, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you by love to Jeſus Chriſt? Or hath it done ſtriving with you in that ſolemn manner and moving upon you in that winning way which formerly it hath done, whereby it made you ſometimes to liſten to its motions? Have you got the maſtery of the Spirit by frequent reſiſtance, that now you will not be jog'd or moved by it? Or hath the Spirit rever thus moved upon you? Will you let us know how it is with you in this matter, that we may the better underſtand what God is doing or about to do? If there be theſe movings, awakenings &amp; allurings of the Spirit in the Souls of men and women in any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaſure among us, it is a good ſigne: But if not, it is ſurely bad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>what preſence of God is with his word in the diſpenſation of it, and what workings of the word there are upon and in the hearts of hearers.</hi> What impreſſion the Word of the Goſpel laboured in, takes: Whether it tends to hardning or ſoftning whether it be a ſeed ſown upon good ground, or as ſeed thrown by the way ſide, or hath only ſome lighter impreſſions.

1. <hi>What ſubduing of hearts and wills is wrought by it,</hi> What ſtrong holds pulled down, what vain refuges diſcovered, what ſinful pleas taken off thereby? Do we ſee thoſe that are Enemies to Chriſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down before him when he rides forth conquering and to conquer by his word? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the Rod of thy ſtringth out of Zion.</hi> 
               <q>The preaching of the Goſpel, accompanyed with the mighty working of the Spirit of Chriſt, is the Rod of ſtrength, or the ſtrong Scepter whereby Chriſt doth mightily ſubdue and govern his people, <hi>Jacks. in loc.</hi>
               </q> And where there is a preſence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit accompanying the diſpenſation of the Word, it will ſubdue hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What heart-breakings and Soul-meltings there are under the Word of God?</hi> How does the hammer of Gods word wielded by the Spirit break the rock in pieces? <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. <hi>Is not my word like a hammer that breakth the rock in pieces?</hi> Does the word divide betwixt the joynts &amp; the marrow, pierce to the diſcerning of the inward thoughts and intents of the heart? Do men and women ſit <hi>trembling</hi> under the hearing of Gods word? Are their Souls plainly and wholly laid open to be <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>bealed</hi> by the word of God? Does the word move and work kindly and ſweetly upon the heart to perſwade, to draw, to inſtruct, to correct, to awe, to unite the heart to God? Does it fully unravel our own woven webs, kindly humble us and make us fall all to pieces, as in our ſelves that we have no kind of thing to take to; and does it ſweetly allure and work up our hearts to an earneſt, hearty and thankful devolving the whole weight and concernment of our reſtleſs, helpleſs Souls upon the everlaſting Arms of a tender and gracious Father in Chriſt Jeſus? Does it bring us to claſp about a ſtrong, gracious and faithful Redeemer and Saviour, as who will hold there and not let him go, becauſe elſe we ſhall periſh? Or is it ſo that the heat of Gods word diſpenſed will not thaw or melt our fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen hearts, how oft ſoever they are held to this fire? <hi>Is not my word like as a fire, ſaith the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What affection there is to the word of God.</hi> What love to, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for and deſire after it. Is it the delight, joy and rejoycing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be hearing, reading and practiſing according to the holy word of God? Is it as it was with David, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Oh how love I thy Law! Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my Soul after thee O God.

            <p n="3">3. Conſider, <hi>What tenderneſs of heart and heart-ſmiting for ſin there is among us?</hi> Where there is much of the grace of the Spirit the heart will be tender, and ſuch a mans heart will ſmite him upon every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt God, and upon every appearance of his anger. As Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah's heart was tender and he humbled himſelf before the Lord upon the hearing of what God ſpeake againſt Judah, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.19. And Davids heart ſmote him upon his inconſiderate raſh actions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. Now what of this heart tenderneſs, and grief, and mourning for ſin and Gods anger is there among us? Does the leaſt tranſgreſſion or miſcarriage wound and grieve the Soul? Is a vain thought a trouble? Is an hypocritical frame or inclination a grief? Any appearance of evil diſquieting, that the leaſt corruption cannot be born without crying to God for deliverance? Or can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons bear away with lighter and leſſer evils, and it may be groſſer miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages alſo? Let ſin go without lamenting, or bewailing it, or being much concerned about it? be looſe in their lives and ungirt in their Religion, and yet full peace?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider, <hi>What lively vehement outgoings of Soul to God in prayer there are among us.</hi> What of humble and holy acceſs, freedome and familiarity with God in ſeeking him. Doe perſons (even Chriſtians) freely, eaſily and as it were naturally pour out their Souls to God? Can they by Faith take hold of God, and wreſtle it out with him, and not let him go till he bleſs them? The ſpirit of <hi>grace</hi> is a ſpirit of <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> alſo, Zech. 12.10. Or is it ſo, that many neglect calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God wholly, others do it, in hypocriſie, many in meer formality, and even Chriſtians themſelves find it exceeding difficult to get up their hearts at any time to any earneſtneſs, or ſuitableneſs in this duty?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider, <hi>what concernment of Soul there is for the glory and work of God among us.</hi> Are we deeply engaged in, heartily taken up about, and diligently labouring in the promoting of Gods work, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his glory? Is it our chief care and principal endeavour that the work of Chriſt may be upheld, continued, and tranſmitted to poſterity? Is every one in his place and capacity thoughtful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about this in good earneſt, that it may be done? Or are we no
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65367:20"/>whit or little concerned about the glory and work of God among us? Are not our own concernments minded more? If we can look to our ſelves, let Chriſt look to himſelf and his work, as the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>All ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſts.</hi> Are there few upon whoſe hearts doth reſt the care and ſollicitude what will become of the Lords work? It is the property of ſuch as inherit any good meaſure of a true Goſpel ſpirit to ſeek the glory of God.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the motions and operations of the Spirit which we are to obſerve in our ſelves and others, and by which we may be directed to diſcern the times, what God is doing or about to do, and what is like to become of us. When theſe things ſhall be, we may look for good times: If there be much of theſe things there is good hope: if little, little hope: if none, no hope: Only we may here, as alwayes elſewhere, reſerve to God his <hi>abſolute Soveraignty</hi> in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Be we never ſo bad, he may of his <hi>Soveraign grace</hi> ſave, or at leaſt ſpare us: Or be we never ſo good, he may of his Soveraign <hi>power</hi> and <hi>dominion,</hi> and in <hi>perfect Juſtice</hi> alſo, hold us under affliction in this life. But according to ordinary diſpenſation we may expect that he will be with us as we be with him. As the working of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in us, ſo the preſence of his mercyes and bleſſings will be with us, his preſence or abſence will be much according as our ſpirits are working towards or from him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him: and if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you: but if ye forſake him, he will forſake you.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay; Then (ſetting aſide what God in his Soveraignty may do) We hope <hi>it will go well with us,</hi> It is probable it will ſo; For there are ſure theſe workings of the Spirit among us. In Anſwer hereto I ſhall only add that it will be needful to conſider theſe things further.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether theſe workings of the Spirit, ſuppoſed among us, may in any ſenſe be ſaid to be general.</hi> That there are ſome few, here and there one that keep themſelves cloſe to God and have a good meaſure of the Spirit breathing in them, for whoſe ſakes we fare the better, is I ſuppoſe beyond queſtion. But whether there be a ſufficient number to obtain the ſparing or ſaving ſuch a place of <hi>light and means</hi> as <hi>New-England</hi> is, at leaſt without the feeling of more ſorrow firſt, may yet be a queſtion. For I am ready to take this for granted, that the ſame
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65367:20"/>number of righteous perſons that might ſave a <hi>ſinning Sodom,</hi> would yet not be enough to ſave a <hi>ſinning Iſrael.</hi> And that becauſe of what the Lord ſayes, <hi>Am.</hi> 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Familyes of the Earth: therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether thoſe workings of the Spirit that appear among us be for the moſt part effectual and ſaving.</hi> Whether they be not moſtly or in great part <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ineffectual,</hi> and ſo iſſue only in <hi>formalities.</hi> It is the <hi>inward ſaving</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> operation of the Spirit that gives us grounded hope of the expectation of ſure mercyes and bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether the breathings and workings of Gods Spirit are more or leſs among us then when we were firſt ſet under a diſpenſation of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If they be <hi>leſs,</hi> yea if they be not <hi>more,</hi> there is little likelihood that we ſhould be delivered from under that Judgment. For it is not probable that that ſhould remove anger, which was not ſufficient to keep it off. If the want of ſuch and ſuch graces and fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath brought us under the Lords diſpleaſure, the ſame defect will ſure be like to continue us there. This therefore muſt not eſcape our conſideration, what difference there is betwixt us then, and now. That there is more ſin, and that iniquity abounds more, ſince Gods hand hath been out againſt us, I think is the general obſervation of all that take notice of any thing: According to that, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I puniſhed them: but they roſe early and corrupted all their doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether <hi>the workings of the Spirit are now growing or decaying among us.</hi> If there be more &amp; more of this gracious work of the Spirit break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth dayly, it is well: But if it grow more rare, and leſs and leſs, and the loſs of good men and women, in whom the Spirit of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently was, is not in ſome good meaſure made up by the reſting of the ſame Spirit upon others riſing up in their ſtead, our caſe looks threatning. But I ſhall ſay no more in this matter. <hi>Who is wiſe and he ſhall underſtand theſe things? prudent and he ſhall know them? For the wayes of the Lord are right, and the juſt ſhall walk in them: but the tranſgreſſors ſhall fall therein,</hi> Hoſ. 14 9.</p>

            <p n="1">1. To all ſuch among us as have any Intereſt at the throne of grace <hi>earneſtly to pray that God would pour out of his Spirit upon us from on high.</hi> Let Gods favourites among us be earneſt in crying unto God in this matter. If there be any ſtrength for wreſtling with God left, improve all the Intereſt you have with God and with his Son that you may prevail for this bleſſing.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65367:21"/>
For Motive, Conſider,</p>
            <p>Mot. 1. <hi>It is the manner of, and is becoming to Gods people to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and wait upon him for all their mercyes.</hi> It is meet we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all our ſpecial bleſſings from God upon our knees. Thus Gods Servants have done, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1, 2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwelleſt in the heavens.—Our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that he have mercy upon us.</hi> We muſt not expect to receive any ſignal mercy unleſs God ſay the word, and that in anſwer to our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayers. What ever mercy God beſtows on his people he will be ſought to by them for it: When he hath any mercy to beſtow on his people he is wont to ſtay till his people ask it, though it is God that puts it into their hearts to ask it. Hence we are bidden in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing by prayer and ſupplication with thanksgiving to let our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts be made known unto God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. We muſt ask the Father in Chriſts name for all. And therefore for this great bleſſing of the pouring out of the Spirit there is all reaſon that we ſhould wait upon God by humble prayer. As the Apoſtles were commanded to wait at Jeruſalem for <hi>the promiſe of the Father,</hi> the ſending down of the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4. and moſt or much of that time they ſpent in praying, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Theſe all continued with one accord in prayer and ſupplication.</hi> And this no doubt was a ſpecial or main part of their prayer, that God would accompliſh his promiſe in the actual pouring down of his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nothing elſe is like to do us good, unleſs God will pour out his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on us.</hi> We have had experience of the <hi>inefficacy</hi> of means upon us to bring us into order and to a good frame.</p>
            <p>Much and frequent <hi>inſtruction</hi> and <hi>warning by the word</hi> hath not done it. We have been taught: what people this day in the world more? It may be ſaid of us, as <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.5. <hi>The juſt Lord is in the midſt thereof.—every morning doth he bring his Judgment to light, he faileth not,</hi> The word of the Lord hath been to us, precept upon precept, line upon line; We have been in that reſpect planted in the houſe of the Lord: But have we not been as the fig-tree, barren Or as the Lord ſpeaks of his Vineyard, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judgements</hi> have not done it. We have been under many: But yet may it not be ſaid of us after all, as of them, <hi>Am.</hi> 4. <hi>Yet have ye not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto me ſaith the Lord?</hi> How true is it of us; <hi>The people turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to him that ſmiteth them?</hi> We have not received correction but refuſed to return.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65367:21"/>
               <hi>Deliverances</hi> do not do it. We have been reſpited. And when we have ſeen there hath been reſpite, have we not been ſecure ſtill? As it was ſaid of Pharaoh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.15. <hi>But when Pharaoh ſaw that there was reſpite, he hardned his heart and hearkned not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Renewal of ſtroaks hath not done it.</hi> After reſpite and deliverance granted God hath taken us into his hand again. But alas! that it ſhould be too truly ſaid of us, <hi>We ſet not our hearts to this alſo.</hi> So that there is little or no hope till this be, till God by his Spirit work a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through change in our hearts. Truly we are grown ſo irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as to ſpiritual concernments, that it is not Gods working upon us only in a rational way that will reclaim us, or bring us to his will: There muſt be in a more then ordinary manner the real energetical operation of his Spirit in us to make us other men and women then we are firſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>An univerſal languiſhing in the inner man is and will be upon us for want of this pouring out of the Spirit.</hi> You your ſelves Chriſtians by your own confeſſion are not ſo capacitated to the exerciſe of grace &amp; duty for want of this. Things go hard with your Souls. Thoſe things which remain are even ready to dy. As <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. Faith, love and other graces they are as it were under a Conſumption, very fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and languid. Iniquities prevail, corruptions get looſe and waſte the ſtrength and vigour of the Soul: And will not you ſtir up your ſelves to pray for the Remedy? This is lamentable, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6, 7. <hi>We all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away: And there is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> And how do ſinners pine away in their iniquities not regarding God nor their own ſtate and condition whileſt they are without the effectual ſtrivings of the holy Spirit with them? Will you not pity them and earneſtly pray for this <hi>healing Remedy</hi> to be given to them? Can you ſee your own Souls pining, and others Souls pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and not be importunate with God to put forth his hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and ſave reſpectively? what will become of faith, holineſs, love to God, his word, Ordinances, wayes and one another, unleſs God be pleaſed to pour out his Spirit on us?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The work of Chriſt is like quickly to ly by, unleſs this be.</hi> If God do not graciouſly appear to give forth his holy Spirit, the work of Chriſt will be like ere long, and it may be not long firſt to fall to the ground for want of perſons ſpirited to manage it and carry it on. And can
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65367:22"/>you be willing to ſee that day, or that it ſhould come though you do not ſee it, and not improve the utmoſt of your intereſt with God to prevent it? Are you Chriſts, and not concerned that the work of Chriſt ſhould, or ſhould be in danger to lye by? Indeed we are like to run all to confuſion and miſery, if God doe not wonderfully and graciouſly appear this way to work for us, to revive us by his Spirit, to ſet us into, and keep us in that order which is according to his will. There is therefore abſolute neceſſity of the effuſion of the Spirit for the continuance of Gods work and glory among us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This will be our great ſecurity againſt the expreſſions of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Ezek.</hi> 39.29. <hi>Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> And ſo it will be our ſecurity in the enjoyment of all bleſſings and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Indeed it is the only ſure way we have to all, or any good. The nearer God <hi>the greateſt good</hi> is to us, the farther ſin <hi>the greateſt evil</hi> will be from us; &amp; there will be peace, quietneſs and rejoycing in the favor of God, and in the gracious effects of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It will be for the great honour of Chriſt.</hi> By the pouring out of the Spirit is manifeſted the <hi>efficacy</hi> of his <hi>Redemption,</hi> and the end and fruit of it obtained, which redounds to his honour. It is a great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the power of Chriſts Redemption and demonſtrates him to be a ſtrong Redeemer, when there is of the travel of his ſoul to be ſeen, and his people are made willing in the day of his power, &amp; hence is he glorified. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8, 10. <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me: and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me — And I am glorified in them.</hi> And will not you pray that Chriſt may be honoured in his ſubduing the hearts of men to himſelf, that this <hi>crown of Glory</hi> may be ſet upon his head?</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>You have a promiſe to improve of Gods pouring out his Spirit.</hi> This is that which the Lord hath ſpoken that he will doe, eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour my Spirit on thy Seed and my bleſſing upon thine offſpring.</hi> So <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28.20. Whence you have a <hi>bottome</hi> for <hi>faith</hi> to reſt upon, an argument to plead in prayer for your children of the riſing generation. You are the Lords people, and to ſuch God in theſe promiſes gives hold to be taken of himſelf in this matter. Beg therefore that God would fulfil his own word, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his own promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65367:22"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſome will ſay; Theſe promiſes and ſo the Text alſo reſpect the latter times, and Gods pouring out his Spirit upon the Jews at their converſion, and bringing home; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what improvement can we make of them for our times?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> If it be granted that they do reſpect <hi>a ſignal diſpenſation</hi> of God to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>laſt</hi> times, yet that hinders not but that there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a <hi>like diſpenſation</hi> of God in accompliſhing theſe promiſes under the Goſpel. Prophetical Scripture is often fulfilled. And though there be in ſpecial one grand accompliſhment of Scripture Propheſies and promiſes: yet there are alſo many Specimens, beginnings of fulfilling them, partile accompliſhments, like diſpenſations of Gods providence, wherein thoſe propheſies and promiſes are fulfilled in their meaſure and degree. And ſo this Propheſy and promiſe of Gods pouring out his Spirit, however it may have its <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> accompliſhment in ſome particular glorious time hereafter: yet there hath been a <hi>glorious</hi> accompliſhment of it already in the Apoſtles times, as we are informed, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. <hi>But this is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Joel; And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt dayes (ſaith God) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, and it is fulfilled in a degree wherever the Goſpel comes with power. Yea, further it is obſerved by ſome; that, <q>There is no particular Church where the light hath ſhined but hath had its ſpecial times, ſome ſolemn day of the pouring out of the Spirit, before the Sun went down; Which may be obſerved either at the firſt breaking up of the Goſpel, or at ſome remarkable time and change of her condition; Whence a great tack of Souls to Chriſt hath followed, beſides the reaching of the Conſcience, and ſtirring the affection of many others under a common work of the Spirit, which uſually goeth along with ſolemn times.</q> 
               <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture, pag.</hi> 142. <hi>Edit.</hi> 2. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray that New England may have ſuch [or another ſuch] a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day, before her Sun go down.</p>

            <p n="9">9. If Chriſtians would <hi>in good earneſt ſet to pray</hi> for this there would be <hi>good hope</hi> that the <hi>Spirit</hi> would be <hi>poured</hi> out upon us. The Lord is not wont to ſay to his people, <hi>ſeek,</hi> or to ſtir them up to <hi>ſeek</hi> him in <hi>vain, Iſa.</hi> 45.19. <hi>I ſaid not unto the Seed of Jacob, ſeek ye me in vain. &amp;</hi> 30.19.

            <p>By all let Chriſtians be perſwaded to <hi>lift up</hi> the hands which hang down, and ſet to prayer, with a deep <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our <hi>want</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> with a <hi>Soul humbling ſenſe,</hi> that we have ſo <hi>grieved</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as thus to forſake and <hi>with hold</hi> its <hi>gracious</hi> operations from us: and alſo with <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>expectation</hi> that God will do this for us for the ſake and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And then we might hope that it would <hi>go well</hi> with us, and that that ſhould be accompliſhed in us which is prayed for by the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>O ſatisfy us early with thy mercy, that we may rejoyce and be glad all our dayes. Make us glad according to the dayes wherein thou haſt afflicted us, and the years wherein we have ſeen evil. Let thy work appear unto thy Servants: and thy glory unto their Children. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and eſtabliſh thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the work of our hands eſtabliſh thou it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Exhortation 2. To <hi>All,</hi> to labour that <hi>the Spirit may be poured out upon them,</hi> that they may hoth have the Spirit, and a plentiful meaſure of the graces of it. Let every one endeavour to get the Spirit for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo there would be a general pouring out of the Spirit. Would we be free from miſery, would we be happy, make this our buſmeſs. Let all unregenerate perſons rouze and ſtir up themſelves, and take the Kingdome of heaven by holy violence. Sue and ſtrive by all means that the ſaving graces of the Spirit may be given to you. If we would have the Spirit poured out upon us, upon our perſons, we muſt be in the way of waiting for it. And O that we could uſe utmoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and endeavours in this thing! It is a matter of moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and everlaſting concernment. I might here urge thoſe two things hinted in the Text, <hi>The miſery of being without,</hi> and <hi>the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of having the Spirit poured out upon us.</hi> which comprehend all can be ſaid. But more particularly by way of motive, conſider.</p>
            <p>Mot. 1. <hi>If you have not the Spirit you are none of Chriſts,</hi> you have no Chriſt, you are Chriſtleſs perſons, and have no more to doe with the Son of God in your preſent ſtate, as to any propriety in him, then the Devils had, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.28. You may talk of Chriſt, and it may be profeſs him, but you have no right nor intereſt in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Now
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65367:23"/>if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> The Spirit is the bond of union on Chriſts part, and it is the Spirit which works Faith in us which is the bond of union on our part: whence Chriſt dwels in his people by his Spirit. Where therefore the Spirit of Chriſt is not, there is no union of that Soul to Chriſt, no faith wrought in the heart, and ſo no Chriſt dwelling in that ſoul. And now ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what it is to be <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> to be <hi>none of his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is to have no pardon of ſin.</hi> No Chriſt, no forgiveneſs. You are yet in your ſins, under the guilt of them, and can have no pardon ſo long as you are without Chriſt. All the ſins that ever you have committed, they ſtand on file againſt you, and you muſt anſwer for them. You lye under the heavy load of the guilt of innumerable evils, the which, if you had any ſenſe, might-make your hearts to fail at the thoughts of it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>For innumerable evils have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about, mine iniquityes have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up: they are more then the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> It is enough to make the heart of any perſon to <hi>fail</hi> indeed, to ſee the load of all his ſins lying upon him unpardoned. What a dreadfull thing is it for us who have been Tranſgreſſors from the womb, endleſs in acting of ſin, to have all our ſins to anſwer for before God, <hi>Job.</hi> 9.3. <hi>If he will contend with him, be cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi> We cannot give a <hi>ſatisfying Anſwer</hi> for one ſingle ſin of a thouſand: But we muſt <hi>anſwer,</hi> that is, we muſt be called to an <hi>account</hi> for them all, if they be not pardoned, and pardoned they are not, if we have not <hi>Chriſt.</hi> In him <hi>pardon</hi> is to be had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God.</hi> But pardon is no where to be had without him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is to have no favour with God.</hi> No Chriſt, no favour in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The heart of God will never be towards any that are not in Chriſt, and that continue out of him. The world is at enmity with God, and reconciliation is only to be had in Chriſt Jeſus. God will enter into friendſhip with, or ſhew favour to no perſon but by the means and mediation of his Son. And therefore if thou art and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueſt without Chriſt, God does and ever will look upon thee as an Enemy, thou ſhalt find no favour in his eyes. <hi>He that made thee will not have mercy on thee he that formed thee will ſhew thee no favour:</hi> There will never be other then anger in the face and heart of God toward;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65367:24"/>We are all by nature children of wrath and Enemies, but they who are gotten into Chriſt they are thereby reconciled, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2, 22. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated and Enemyes in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath be reconciled, in the body of his fleſh through death,</hi> &amp;c. But for others the wrath of God <hi>abides</hi> on them, and there it will abide to Eternity, for they can have no favour, if they continue out of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is to have no Salvation.</hi> No Chriſt, no Salvation. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe men may have, if they have not Chriſt, they can never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is none other Name under Heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved, Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life.</hi> Poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! what doſt thou dream of Heaven, happineſs, eternal life &amp; glory &amp; haſt no Chriſt? All thy hopes will prove to be but vain dreams, and will in the end vaniſh, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is to be reprobate,</hi> i. e. <hi>diſapproved, diſallowed and rejected of God, Jer.</hi> 6.30. <hi>Reprobate [or refuſe and rejectea] ſilver ſhall men call them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Know you not your own ſolves how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates.</hi> They who are without Chriſt, though they may not be <hi>Reprobate,</hi> as the word is oppoſed to <hi>Elect;</hi> yet in their preſent ſtate and as to what appears they are no better then thoſe that are reprobate. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing under Goſpel enjoyments without getting into Chriſt is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſymptome of everlaſting Reprobation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is to be Satans.</hi> If thou art none of Chriſts, thou art the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. The poſſeſſion of men in the world is divided betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Satan.</hi> What <hi>Chriſt</hi> poſſeſſes not are under <hi>Satans power</hi> and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Know therefore that if Chriſt hath no poſſeſſion of thee, thou art poſſeſſed of the Devil. Moſt lamentable tydings I bring to all unconverted ſinners, <hi>you are poſſeſſed by the Devil:</hi> you are in the hands of that cruel Enemy of Souls, in the paw of that roaring <hi>Lyon</hi> who goes about ſeeking whom he may devour. Is it not a dreadful thing to have the <hi>body</hi> poſſeſſed? See <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.2,—5. <hi>There met him out of the Tombs a man with an unclean Spirit.—And alwayes night and day he was in the mountains and in the Tombs, crying and cutting himſelf with ſtones.</hi> But how much more dreadful is it to have the <hi>Soul</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils poſſeſſion? Ah ſinner! Haſt thou any reaſon to laugh and be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65367:24"/>merry, to enjoy one good hour, whileſt thou art under the hand of ſo cruel a maſter and murtherer of Souls as thou art? He hath his will upon thee, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Who are taken captive by him as his will.</hi> The evil Spirit worketh in the Children of diſobedience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. He trades there; In ſome he keeps open ſhop, ſetting forth his wares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world in thoſe abominations and villanyes by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: In others he deals more underhand, he does not appear ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but yet he is at work in the heart of every child of diſobedience. Every ſinner is the Devils <hi>factor,</hi> and erelong unleſs thou withdraw from his ſervice he will pay thee thy wages. Every Chriſtleſs ſinner is under Satans power: Hence when perſons are converted, they are turned from the power of Satan, delivered from the power of darkneſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>To open their eyes and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Col. 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus remember and conſider that if you have not the Spirit of Chriſt you are none of Chriſts, and if none of Chriſts, then what and whoſe you are.</p>
            <p>Mot. 2. <hi>If you have not the Spirit you are worth nothing.</hi> The true worth and value of men is according to what of the Spirit of God is in them. And therefore Pharaoh judged right of Joſeph on this account that he was <hi>an eminent man, a man in whom the Spirit of God was,</hi> Gen. 41.38. But if you are without this, whatever rate you may value your ſelves at, or others may value you, you are indeed good for nothing.</p>
            <p>For, 1. <hi>You know nothing of that which is only worth the knowing, and to which all other knowledge ought to be ſubſervient.</hi> You know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the things of God and his Kingdome, of the myſteries of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with God in Chriſt. Speculative knowledge you may have, but practical ſaving knowledge you have none, for the true ſaving knowledge of theſe is only attained by the help of the Spirit, which you are without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11,—14. <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God — But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> You have little reaſon any one of you, he that knows moſt, to boaſt of, or be lifted up with your knowledge, for you know nothing as you ought to know. <hi>The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65367:25"/>Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. And therefore whatever you may imagine, or ſpeak, or reaſon concerning ſpiritual things, it is but even as the blind mans imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſcourſe and reaſoning concerning Colours: It is very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly: You do not really underſtand any thing about them. <hi>Si Chriſtum neſcis, nihil eſt ſi catera diſcis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You can do no good thing.</hi> You have no ability to perform any good action. We are all naturally ſo impotent that we can do nothing that is good unleſs we have the Spirit to help our infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities:</hi> Which you have not. We cannot take any ſtep in a right path without the manudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and leading of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God, Pſal.</hi> 51.12. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phold me with thy free Spirit:</hi> But you have no ſuch guide. All ſpiritual life and every action of life it comes from the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it nothing is to be done: And therefore let me tell you who have none of the Spirit of God, you never did any thing well in your lives, not any thing that God will accept.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>You have no good in you.</hi> All the good that is or ever was in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man, it is wrought by the Spirit of God. And therefore if you have none of the Spirit of God, you have no real good in you. You may have theſe and thoſe good natural diſpoſitions, and ſome ſhews of good, but as for any ſpiritual, ſaving good that will abide the tryal when God ſhall judge what is good and what is bad, you have none of it. And therefore it may be ſaid truly of you (whatever you may think of your good heart, &amp;c.) your heart is little worth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> It is little worth indeed, for it is worth nothing. Hence is it ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.119. <hi>God putteth away all the wicked of the Earth like droſs:</hi> they being of no worth. Thus you ſee you are worth nothing, good for nothing, if you have not the Spirit of God in you: But they in whom the Spirit of God dwells, they are the <hi>excellent upon the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 16.3. They are <hi>Gods Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, Mal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>In that day when I make up my Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mot. 3. <hi>If you do not get the Spirit of God to be in you, you will be like to be guilty of New-Englands ruine.</hi> I ſpeak now to the Generation coming on upon the Stage; if you or a conſiderable number of you do not take care to be right ſpirited for God, that you may duely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his work and carry it on, and ſerve the God of you Fathers with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65367:25"/>a perfect heart and willing mind, you will be like to deſtroy and lay this pleaſant land deſolate, your irreligion will be an occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.34. <hi>He turneth a fruitful land into barrenneſs for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of them that dwell therein.</hi> Your ſin, your degeneracy, your not owning and worſhipping God in Spirit will provoke God to lay it deſolate, and then it will be charged upon you, you will be reputed guilty of it, as being you who have done it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.11,—14: <hi>But they refuſed to hearken, &amp;c.—for they ſaid the pleaſant land deſolate.</hi> There is the fault and there will it be charged. And what a dreadful thing will it be to have the ſpoiling of ſuch a bleſſed work as God hath here begun, to ly at our door?</p>
            <p>Mot. 4. <hi>While you are without the Spirit of God you are in extream danger.</hi> You go in jeopardy of your lives, the lives of your Souls eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour. If this night thy Soul ſhould be called for, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thee, who haſt none of the Spirit of Chriſt? Aſſuredly Chriſt will ſay of you; <hi>I know you not, depart from me ye, workers of iniquity.</hi> And then how fearful would your condition be? <hi>There ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> This is the danger you are in while the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not given to you. There is but a ſtep betwixt your Souls and eternal death. Sentence of condemnation is paſt upon you already, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> Hell does as it were gape for you, your condition is extreamly perilous. Did ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners know in what danger of the lives of their immortal Souls they walk in every hour they are without the Spirit of Chriſt, they would never ſing care away with vain mirth and paſtime, or pleaſe themſelves with ſome ſhew and formality of Religion only. Oh the fearful ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſecurity of men and women that can ſleep quietly and take their eaſe upon the brink of eternal miſery!</p>
            <p>Mot. 5. <hi>Conſider, you know not how little time you may have for the getting of the Spirit.</hi> And therefore labour to get it quickly. It is certain you have but a ſhort time to work in, but how ſhort is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. We have ſeen and ſee dayly how ſuddenly they are cut down, by the Sword, and now by this ſore diſeaſe God hath ſent among us, who in probability might have lived many dayes. Theſe eſpecially are times wherin none can promiſe himſelf continuance of life. Thou haſt this day an opportunity of hearing the word of the Goſpel, and it may be mayſt be ſomething moved by it; But who knows but that ſome of us here may never have another? Oh that the preſent time
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65367:26"/>could be improved by us all to ſtrike the ſtroke for Eternity! The preſent time is only ours, and to know and improve that, is our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation.</hi> If we now improve it, it ſhall be a day of ſalvation to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.15. <hi>While it is ſaid, To day, if ye will hear his voice, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hearts.</hi> If we neglect making out after the Spirit to day, we know not <hi>what ſhall be on the morrow, Jam.</hi> 4 14. None knows <hi>what a day may bring forth, Prov.</hi> 27.1. Another day may bring the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinner into eternal flames. God tells us that <hi>his Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with men, Gen.</hi> 6.3. And if the Spirit of God have once done ſtriving with us, then the time and hope of our getting the Spirit is paſt and gone alſo. Now therefore while time and the day of grace laſts look about you leſt the opportunity be loſt and you be undone for ever.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall now ask; <hi>How ſhall we do to get the Spirit of God pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon us and dwelling in us?</hi> There is a great deal of duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon us in this reſpect. We muſt not ſit ſtill and ſay, It is not in our power to get the Spirit: God expects that his word ſhould ſtir us up to careful endeavours, that we ſhould up and be doing, if ſo the Lord will be with us. If we ſit ſtill we are ſure to periſh, but if we ſtir up and ſet our ſelves to ſeek him, who knows but the Lord may help us ſo to ſeek him as that he may be ſound of us? Something therefore of our duty in order hereto I ſhall endeavour to ſet before you in theſe following Directions. And the ſame courſe is to be taken for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an encreaſe of the graces of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Labour for a ſerious conſiderate frame.</hi> Duely to pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and weigh things eſpecially matters of Eternity. Seriouſly mind what your ſtate, what your danger, what your work is. That is the woful bane of many a Soul they do not conſider, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.3. <hi>My people doth not conſider.</hi> They do not throughly think of things, ſome ſlight notions and workings they may have about them, but it is not to purpoſe. I believe there are many who think they are converted, and have the Spirit of God, who never ſet themſelves to purpoſe to think what converſion was, what ſin is from which they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert; what God, Chriſt and holineſs is, to which they ſhould convert, and what it is to have the Spirit of God. It is a dreadful Judgement of God upon Goſpel ſinners, that <hi>in ſeeing</hi> they <hi>ſee not,</hi> they have ſome flighty ſight and apprehenſions of things, but they do not ſee them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65367:26"/>and to purpoſe: They know every thing almoſt about Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but they feel nothing, and ſo indeed know nothing.

            <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Remove all prejudices againſt the Spirit out of your hearts.</hi> Our hearts naturally are full of prejudice againſt the Spirit and the wayes and workings of it, of which we muſt labour to get them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There are thoſe things wont to be mentioned (<hi>as in the Author but now quoted, p.</hi> 639) wherein we are apt to take up prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit. 1. Againſt the humbling work of the Spirit. 2. The mortifying work of the Spirit. 3. The ſanctifying work of the Spirit. 4. The Deriſions that beſal men for the Spirits ſake. That which I have eſpecial reference to here is that we ſhould get removed all <hi>prejudice</hi> againſt the <hi>mortifying</hi> and <hi>ſanctifying work</hi> of the Spirit. Beware of being offended at the way of walking in the Spirit for the ſtrictneſs of it, as if it were too ſtreight to be reſtrained from theſe and thoſe fleſh pleaſing actions, and to be tyed to theſe and thoſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dutyes and ſervices. Be ſo far from looking upon theſe as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as that on the contrary you may account them moſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and indeed moſt pleaſant: As <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſs.</hi> And account that it is your naughty heart only that makes you think them tedious and irkſome. By all means get your hearts <hi>reconciled</hi> to thoſe wayes, in which the Spirit of God leads thoſe he dwels in, that you may from the heart account thoſe happy who by the help and grace of the Spirit can and do walk in them, and that you ſhould account it your own greateſt happineſs if you could obtain to have and walk in the Spirit, and in all the wayes thereof, and that every way and work of the Spirit of God may be very precious &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable to you.

            <p>Dir. 4. <hi>Get your hearts preſſed with the intollerable load and burthen of ſin, of which you can no way be eaſed but by the preſence and help of the Spirit of God.</hi> Never reſt nor be quiet till you come to ſee the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, infinite, endleſs evil that is in ſin, to be ſenſible that it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable burthen. That is the reaſon why many are ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65367:27"/>about obtaining the Spirit of God to help and relieve them; they are not duely ſenſible of the dreadful burthen and load of their ſin that lyes upon them. They have ſome lighter convictions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations it may be for ſome groſſer ſins, but they are not deep, ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor through enough: They are not ſick unto death of their ſin, and hence they do not look for, or not very earneſtly for the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. It may be they have ſome phyſick of their own, ſomething com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in their own Kitchin, ſome courſe or work of their own, that they account will do the deed, expiate for their ſin, and preſerve them from periſhing; and ſo they look no further. Or if they do look out to this great Phyſitian of Souls, it is only to get ſome directions what they may do themſelves for themſelves, and they themſelves will get it, work it and adminiſter it, and ſo they reſt ſtill upon their own doing: They are not brought ſo low in themſelves, as utterly and for ever to deſpair of their own ſtrength and skill to recover themſelves, and hence they do not yield themſelves wholly and fully to be healed by the Spirit of Chriſt, they do not ſee ſuch need of it. Labour therefore by all means to ſee clearly the deadly wound that ſin hath given you, and to have your hearts broken all to pieces under the ſenſe thereof. So long as you are whole in your ſelf, or think you can make your ſelf whole, you will ſee no need of the Phyſitian: But if you be thus ſick, heart ſick of ſin, you will then feel an abſolute need of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, you will then prize and look after him, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.12. <hi>They that be whole need not a Phyſitian, but they that are ſick.</hi> Sit not down at quiet till ſin become moſt exceeding bitter. <q>

Mourning for ſin cannot be too much, if it raiſe the price of Chriſt in the Soul, and draw out a more earneſt deſire of the applying work of the Spirit to be wrought in the heart.</p>

Tell the Lord in humble manner what need you have of his Spirit, what your miſery is without it, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beg of him that he will give you his holy Spirit, to work faith, repentance and all other graces in you. And for your encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſider what Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children: how much more ſhall your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5.

Let <hi>Sabbaths</hi> be obſerved, <hi>Ordinances</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>meditation, ſelf examination, prayer,</hi> ſecret, Family and publick prayer, <hi>reading the word</hi> of God; And eſpecially the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the word: Oh wait there; By that, the <hi>word</hi> of God <hi>diſpenſed,</hi> the Spirit is pleaſed to convey himſelf. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called the <hi>miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8.

Therefore attend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> pray before you come, pray when you go from hearing of the word, that it might be a bleſſed means to conveigh the Spirit to you: And when you come to the word attend with all your might, hear as for your lives, do not heedleſly let ſlip any one Sentence without your careful attention. Expect, wait, long, look when, by what ſentence, by what word ſpoken God will let in his ſpirit into your Souls.

Many being ſome way or other rouzed, for a fit are very earneſt, but not finding the Spirit of God to come quickly, they give over, they are ſoon cooled, and content themſelves with their former formalities in the exerciſes of Religion. Take heed we do not caſt away our Souls here: How many, many periſh here! Roſolve ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to give over ſeeking and waiting till God be gracious to you, and pour out his Spirit upon you. If God give you not the holy Spirit to be your Comforter, reſolve never to take comfort, but ly down in ſorrow.

            <p>Direct. 9. <hi>Make this the buſineſs of your lives.</hi> Look upon it as the main thing you came into the world for. Lay out the ſtrength of your Souls about it. Drive on this as if you had nothing elſe to mind or do: Make this your work to get the Spirit of God to be in you, and all other things ſubordinate and ſubſervient to this. Do not think that for a ſinner to obtain all the gracious operations of the Spirit in himſelf, to get a due ſenſe of ſin as moſt odious and loathſome, and to reſt his Soul upon Chriſt as moſt pretious, and to ſhew forth all the bleſſed fruits of the Spirit in his converſation, is a work eaſily or quickly done: And yet you muſt not reſt till you come to this, till there be the apparent, manifeſt, full breathings and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit in you. As Mercy is not like to come to us till the Spirit be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon us from on high: So let us wait and labour till the Spirit be poured out upon us, fingly and generally, that the wilderneſs may become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a Forreſt, and ſo thoſe mercyes and bleſſings which are conſequent to this may be derived down to, and ſetled upon us. For a cloſe, let every ſincere one, whoſe heart is upon the work and glory of Chriſt, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and earneſtly joyn with the Pſalmiſt in that prayer &amp; profeſſion of his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.6. <hi>O that the Salvation of Iſrael were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivity of his people, Jacob ſhall rejoyce, and Iſrael ſhall be glad.</hi>
